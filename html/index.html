            <p class="proj-inside">
              Though this application is nothing fancy, it is where I first
              applied JavaScript to bring functionality into HTML. User - or
              should I say "the player" is prompted to guess a random number
              between 1 - 100 while alert messages hint the player if their
              guess was too high or low. Guessing a number in this range should
              be possible with maximum of 7 attempts. Exactly that is also the
              limit for guesses here.<br />
              This mini-project does not have any styling - probably the only
              reason why it hasn't reached millions of high paying customers.
              <br /><br />
              Oh! And it is built using quite aggressive and persistent alert
              prompts.

              CYOA - Choose your own adventure, is typically text based
              adventure game, where the player gets to make choices for the
              character they are controlling, usually in a fantasy setting.
              These kind of games first gathered popularity in the form of a
              book. Once migrated onto digital plane they still consist mostly
              of plain text with minimal design elements.<br />
              Here is my version of such adventure where player takes the reigns
              of not-so-fictiona character who's name is Paan. And yes, he is
              me. Objective of the player is to guide this not-so-fictional
              character to find his path to a certain location - the school. And
              the clock is ticking..

        <h2 class="welcome">
          Greetings! I am Paan Kaur Riives and this is my portfolio
        </h2>
        <p class="text-normal">
          My first real contact with software development was at the age of 31,
          when I was accepted to Tartu Vocational College.<br />
          Since joining the college, I have remained adamant about this field,
          which is software engineering. Through a mainly hands-on learning
          approach, we have focused on front-end development.
          <br /><br />
          I am confident in my CSS, HTML, JavaScript and React.js skills, which
          are the main focus of my first - currently ongoing - year of
          school.<br />
          I am also familiar with back-end solutions, having used Node.js for
          some of my school projects.<br />
          I also consider myself a bit of a self-proclaimed SQL expert, though
          every new exercise and technique seems determined to prove me
          wrong.<br /><br />
          Outside of my starting software development career, I am greatly
          enjoying strategic board games with friends. When none are around, I
          am usually found honing my Rubik's Cube speedsolving or blind-folded
          skills.<br />

          <br />Find out more about my projects or my contact information by
          clicking on any of the tabs above.
