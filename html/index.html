            <p class="proj-inside">
              Though this application is nothing fancy, it is where I first used
              JavaScript to bring functionality into HTML. User - or should I
              say "the player" is prompted to guess a random number between 1 -
              100 while alert messages hint the player if their guess was too
              high or low. Guessing a number in this range should be possible
              with maximum of 7 attempts. Exactly that is also the limit for
              guesses here.<br />
              This mini-project does not have any styling - probably the only
              reason why it hasn't reached millions of high paying customers.

            <p class="proj-inside">
              CYOA - Choose your own adventure, is typically text based
              adventure game, where the player gets to make choices for the
              character they are controlling, usually in a fantasy setting.
              These kind of games first gathered popularity in the form of a
              book. Once migrated onto digital plane they still consist mostly
              of plain text with minimal design elements.<br />
              Here is my version of such adventure where player takes the reigns
              of not-so-fictiona character who's name is Paan. And yes, he is
              me. Objective of the player is to guide this not-so-fictional
              character to find his path to a certain location - the school. And
              the clock is ticking..

        <p class="text-normal">
          My first real contact with software development was at the age of 31
          when I was accepted to Tartu Vocational College.<br />
          Since joining the college, I have remained adamant about this field
          that is software engineering. Through mainly hands-on learning
          approach, we have focused on front-end development.
          <br />
          I am confident in my CSS, HTML and JavaScript skills which are the
          main focus for my first - currently ongoing year of school.<br />
          I am also familiar with back-end solutions having used Node.js for
          some of my school projects.<br />
          I also consider myself a bit of a self-proclaimed SQL expert - though
          every new exercise and technique seems determined to prove me
          wrong.<br />
